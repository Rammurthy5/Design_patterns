"""
allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. 
The object appears to change its class. It's often used to eliminate large, 
unwieldy conditional statements (like if-elif-else or switch cases) that depend on the object's state.

The pattern has 3 main components:
1. Context: The object whose behavior changes (e.g., a door, a player, an order).
2. State Interface: Defines a common interface for all concrete states.
3. Concrete States: Classes that implement the state interface and define the specific behavior for that state.

real-world e.g.: traffic light system, vending machine.
